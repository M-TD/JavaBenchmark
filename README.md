# RaspberryPiBenchmark
simple benchmark for the raspberry pi using java forkjoinpool

# Starting the program
- clone the program
- compile the program using the java compiler

- execute the program by typing the name of the program and add after it the starting number and the number of times it should double the value before it

- e.g RaspberryPiBenchmark 2000 10

- this will run the program with starting number 2000 and run it 10 times, each time doubling the value before it
